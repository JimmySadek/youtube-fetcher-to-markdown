## Video Description
The creator's description, links, and chapter markers...

## Transcript
The complete caption text...
```

The YAML frontmatter makes a collection queryable through tools such as
[Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), while the Markdown
remains portable to Logseq, other knowledge bases, and plain text workflows.

## Why this exists

Most transcript extractors stop at raw caption text. An archival knowledge note
also needs the source URL, creator, capture date, actual language, description,
chapters, and a predictable filename. YouTube Fetcher keeps that complete record
in one local file.

## Features

- Manual and auto-generated captions with optional timestamps
- Clickable timestamps and chapters that jump to the moment in the video
- Ordered language preferences, regional variants, automatic selection, and strict language matching
- Explicit YouTube translation, labeled with source language and machine-translation provenance
- Title, channel, duration, upload date, description, and chapters when available
- Safe YAML frontmatter and Markdown tables for dynamic metadata
- File protection for every format, safe replacement, and refreshes that update existing notes in place
- Obsidian-vault and custom-directory output
- Plain text, JSON, SRT, and WebVTT export
- Bounded network requests, useful errors, and optional metadata-free capture
- No API keys and no hosted service

## Installation

### Install the skill

```bash
npx skills add JimmySadek/youtube-fetcher-to-markdown
```

Or clone the canonical repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JimmySadek/youtube-fetcher-to-markdown.git
```

### Install runtime dependencies

Python 3.8–3.14 is supported for captions. Python 3.10 or newer is recommended
for current optional `yt-dlp` releases. From the cloned or installed skill
directory, use an isolated environment so your system Python stays unchanged:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python scripts/fetch_transcript.py --check-deps
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\fetch_transcript.py --check-deps
```

Activate that environment before using the `python3` examples below (`source
.venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux), or use the full interpreter path each time.
An agent should also use that interpreter. If your skill installation is read-only,
create the environment in a writable location and pass the full path to
`requirements.txt`.

`yt-dlp` is optional for descriptions, chapters, duration, and upload dates:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip install yt-dlp
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install yt-dlp
```

Put its executable on PATH by activating the environment. Without it, oEmbed
still supplies title and channel when accessible. The script never installs
packages automatically. `--no-metadata` skips both metadata providers.

## Usage

```bash
python3 scripts/fetch_transcript.py "https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID"
```

An agent using the skill resolves `scripts/fetch_transcript.py` relative to its
installed `SKILL.md`; it does not depend on one fixed home-directory path.

### Output location

The first configured option wins:

1. `--output` for one exact file
2. `--output-dir` for this run
3. `YOUTUBE_FETCHER_DIR` for a persistent directory
4. `~/yt_transcripts/` by default

```bash
# Save this note to an Obsidian vault
python3 scripts/fetch_transcript.py URL --output-dir ~/Notes/MyVault

# Set a persistent default
export YOUTUBE_FETCHER_DIR=~/Notes/MyVault
python3 scripts/fetch_transcript.py URL

# Save to one exact file
python3 scripts/fetch_transcript.py URL --output ~/Notes/video.md
```

Every format preserves an existing destination and exits with code `3`, before
making a network request when the destination is already known. This is the same
in terminals and agent sessions; there is no hidden interactive prompt. `--force`
replaces the chosen file completely, including any annotations. A default
Markdown refresh reuses the existing note's path even if its title or capture date
has changed. An explicit `--output` is honored independently of other notes for
the same video, so distinct files can hold different languages or versions.

Writes use a temporary file beside the destination. Where the filesystem supports
hard links, a new file appears only once its UTF-8 content is complete. Other
filesystems use exclusive creation: they still refuse to open an existing file
for writing, but a new file can be visible during the write. Handled write failures
remove that partial file; abrupt termination or disk failure can leave it behind.
Forced refreshes replace a completed temporary file and preserve existing POSIX
permission modes. New notes use normal file-creation permissions.

If another process creates the destination during a fetch, the non-force write
still refuses to overwrite it. `--stdout` prints only the result
and creates no file, even when output-path options are present; diagnostics go to
stderr.

### Languages and translation

```bash
# Prefer French, then German, with English as the final fallback
python3 scripts/fetch_transcript.py --lang fr,de -- URL

# Require Japanese captions; fail clearly if unavailable
python3 scripts/fetch_transcript.py --lang ja --strict-lang -- URL

# Capture available captions when you do not know their language
python3 scripts/fetch_transcript.py --lang auto -- URL

# Explicit YouTube machine translation of an available track into English
python3 scripts/fetch_transcript.py --lang auto --translate en -- URL

# Inspect caption tracks and supported translation targets
python3 scripts/fetch_transcript.py --list -- URL
```

Language preference outranks caption type. For each requested language, exact
codes are tried before regional variants (`es` can select `es-MX`); manual
captions win within that match. All requested languages precede English fallback.
`--strict-lang` disables that fallback, while still allowing regional variants.
The default remains `--lang en` for compatibility.

`auto` selects a manual track if available, otherwise a generated track, using
YouTube's track order for ties. It does **not** establish the original audio
language. Selection and fallback are reported to stderr and recorded in the note.
Translation happens only with `--translate`, requires support from YouTube, and
is never described as a human translation.

Markdown records `requested_language`, `source_language`, `language` (the actual
output language), `caption_type` (the original track's type), `translated`, and
`translation_provider` when applicable. `metadata_source` distinguishes `yt-dlp`,
`oembed`, `unavailable`, and deliberately `skipped` metadata. Existing frontmatter
keys remain compatible. JSON keeps its existing array of `{text, start, duration}`
objects; raw exports have no provenance wrapper, so retain stderr or use Markdown
when that context matters.

### Transcript and subtitle exports

```bash
python3 scripts/fetch_transcript.py --stdout --timestamps -- URL
python3 scripts/fetch_transcript.py --format txt --stdout -- URL
python3 scripts/fetch_transcript.py --format json --output captions.json -- URL
python3 scripts/fetch_transcript.py --format srt -- URL
python3 scripts/fetch_transcript.py --format vtt -- URL
```

`text` and `markdown` both produce an archival Markdown note; `txt` produces plain
caption text. Timestamped Markdown and chapter lists link to the corresponding
video time. Raw exports skip metadata requests. A raw ID starting with `-` works
after `--`; put all options before that separator.

### Options

| Flag | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `--output` / `-o` | Save to one exact file |
| `--output-dir` | Save inside a directory or knowledge vault |
| `--timestamps` / `-t` | Add linked Markdown timestamps or plain timestamps in `txt` |
| `--lang` / `-l` | One code, ordered comma-separated codes, or `auto`; default `en` |
| `--strict-lang` | Disable English fallback |
| `--translate` | Explicit YouTube machine translation to a target language |
| `--source` / `-s` | Override the capture-project name |
| `--format` / `-f` | `text`/`markdown` (default), `txt`, `json`, `srt`, or `vtt` |
| `--no-description` | Skip the description and chapters section |
| `--no-metadata` | Skip yt-dlp and oEmbed while retaining captions and source URL |
| `--timeout` | Connect/read timeout per HTTP request, in seconds; default `15` |
| `--stdout` | Print the result instead of saving it |
| `--list` | Show available caption languages |
| `--force` | Replace the destination or refresh an existing default note in place |
| `--check-deps` | Report dependency status |

### Supported YouTube inputs

- Standard watch URLs, regardless of query-parameter order
- `youtu.be` short links
- `/embed/`, `/shorts/`, `/live/`, and legacy `/v/` links
- Mobile and YouTube Music watch URLs
- Privacy-enhanced `youtube-nocookie.com/embed/` links
- A raw 11-character video ID

Lookalike hosts such as `youtube.com.example.org` are rejected.

## Compatibility

The repository follows the portable `SKILL.md` format. The same install command
works with Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, and other compatible
agents. Manual users can run the Python script directly.

## Capabilities and limitations

- **Network:** contacts YouTube captions and oEmbed; optionally invokes `yt-dlp`
  for richer metadata.
- **Filesystem:** reads Markdown frontmatter in the selected directory to detect
  duplicates, writes a temporary sibling file, and publishes the requested output.
- **Subprocess:** uses the local `yt-dlp` executable with user configuration,
  playlist expansion, caching, and downloads disabled. Its process timeout is
  twice `--timeout`; individual HTTP requests each have their own timeout.
- Videos must expose captions. Private, restricted, or caption-disabled videos
  may fail.
- It does not download video/audio, run Whisper, identify speakers, or inspect
  visuals. YouTube machine translation is opt-in.
- Captions may contain recognition errors; the archive preserves source text
  rather than silently correcting, summarizing, or treating it as instructions.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to do |
|---------|------------|
| Missing dependencies / exit `2` | Install `requirements.txt` into an isolated environment, then use that interpreter. Invalid options also use exit `2`. |
| No matching language | Run `--list`; choose an available code or `--lang auto`. `--lang` selects captions, while `--translate` translates them. |
| Request blocked | Stop repeated requests. Try later from a permitted local network or supply an existing transcript. The script does not automatically access cookies, buy proxies, or change networks. |
| Disabled, private, or restricted captions | Check that the video is publicly playable and captions are accessible. No transcript is fabricated. |
| Timeout | Check connectivity or increase `--timeout`. This is a per-request connect/read limit, not a whole-command deadline. |
| No description/title metadata | Captions can still succeed. Check `metadata_source`; use `--no-metadata` when metadata is unnecessary. |
| Existing file / exit `3` | Choose a different `--output` or explicitly approve replacement with `--force`. |
| Save error | Check the directory, permissions, and available disk space. Replacing a symbolic-link destination is refused. |

The [upstream caption library](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api)
uses YouTube's undocumented caption interface. YouTube changes and network
blocking can still prevent capture; passing offline tests cannot guarantee access.

## Development

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 -m py_compile scripts/fetch_transcript.py
bash .scripts/verify-isolated-install.sh
```

Tests substitute the external caption service while exercising real caption
objects, CLI formats, language choices, file preservation, failures, and timeout
configuration. They write only to temporary directories. The installation probe
uses a temporary project; it does not replace your installed skill.

<details>
<summary>Exit codes</summary>

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Invalid video input, fetch failure, or filesystem error |
| `2` | Missing required dependency or invalid command-line options |
| `3` | Existing note preserved; overwrite not approved |
| `130` | Cancelled by the user |

</details>

### Maintaining and releasing

`main` is the canonical development branch. The automated `master` mirror is
retained for older raw-file links; do not delete it or develop on it. See
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/JimmySadek/youtube-fetcher-to-markdown/releases)
for tagged versions and upgrade notes.

For a release, run the local checks above and the isolated install probe, open a
pull request, and wait for every Linux, Windows, and macOS CI job. Merge only the
checked revision, verify post-merge CI and the legacy mirror, then tag that exact
commit and publish its release notes. Verify installation from a fresh clone of
the public tag. Live caption tests are useful release evidence but are kept out
of CI because YouTube may block hosted runners.

The [reliability and language record](specs/youtube-fetcher-reliability-and-languages.md)
contains the v1.2 verification evidence. The older
[v1.1 distribution record](specs/youtube-fetcher-v1-1-release-and-distribution.html)
preserves historical channel decisions; dated adoption numbers are snapshots.
Directory promotion and external listings are separate from engineering releases.
